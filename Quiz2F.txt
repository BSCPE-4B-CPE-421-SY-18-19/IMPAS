The cables and wires are also fully functional, therefore, there is a continuous flow
of electricity.

	With the right source and correct voltage, the unit would then be functional.
And if it's connected correctly with the devices, the Raspberry Pi will run without
errors. The mouse and the keyboard attached or connected to it are also functional.
Therefore, there is nothing wrong with the unit and is functioning properly, error-free.
