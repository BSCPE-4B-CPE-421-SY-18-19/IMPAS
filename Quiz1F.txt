Observations:

	The moment we powered up the system unit;
	-> the LED on the motherboard lit up
	-> the  monitor didn't display anything
	-> the fans functioned well at first
	-> after a few seconds, the system unit/computer turned off
	-> we think that the power supply is faulty

Probable Solutions:
	
	-> First, there must be a problem in the power supply so check if the cables are plugged properly.
	-> If possible, replace the power supply. If the problems persist, there might be a problem with the
	   motherboard.
	-> Clean the system unit, the accumulated dirt and dust might cause the fluctuation of current or any
	   issue.
